For this article you should focus on the findings for reported in section 3.1. and 3.1.1.  Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 3.1. Visual search

> Manual and eye-tracking measures provided converging evidence for social stimuli being more distracting than non-social stimuli, with the effects interacting with learning over successive blocks (see Table 1 for descriptives).

> 3.1.1. Manual search time (s)

> A repeated-measures ANOVA with two within-subject factors (distractor: social, non-social; block: one, two, three), revealed a main effect of block, F(1.47, 52.89) = 395.23, p = < 0.001, η2 = 0.92, driven by decreasing search time across blocks. There was no main effect of distractor on search time, F(1, 36) = 0.38, p > 0.250, η2 = 0.01, but there was a significant distractor-by-block interaction, F(1.94, 69.98) = 3.78, p = 0.029, η2 = 0.10.
