For this article you should focus on the findings for reported in section 3.1. and 3.1.1.  Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 3.1. Visual search

> Manual and eye-tracking measures provided converging evidence for social stimuli being more distracting than non-social stimuli, with the effects interacting with learning over successive blocks (see Table 1 for descriptives).

> 3.1.1. Manual search time (s)

> We first investigated whether participants learned target locations across blocks, and whether distractor type affected this learning. Decreasing search time over blocks indicated learning and there was a moderating effect of distractor on learning slopes. AIC model averaging with manual response times during the visual search task revealed that the coefficient estimates for block as well as the distractor-by-block interaction term were significantly different from zero, indicating they had significant effects on the model (Table 2). A repeated-measures ANOVA with two within-subject factors (distractor: social, non-social; block: one, two, three), revealed a main effect of block, F(1.47, 52.89) = 395.23, p = < 0.001, η2 = 0.92, driven by decreasing search time across blocks. There was no main effect of distractor on search time, F(1, 36) = 0.38, p > 0.250, η2 = 0.01, but there was a significant distractor-by-block interaction, F(1.94, 69.98) = 3.78, p = 0.029, η2 = 0.10. Although Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc tests revealed no significant differences in search time between social and non-social scenes in each block separately (block one: p = 0.218, block two: p = 0.215, block three: p = 0.135), and highly significant differences between blocks for both social and non-social scenes separately (p < 0.001), there was a significant interaction between distractor and block in the linear contrasts, F(1, 36) = 5.13, p = 0.030, η2 = 0.13, suggesting a difference in slope across blocks between social and non-social scenes.
